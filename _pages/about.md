I am an Artificial Intelligence developer with a passion for problem solving.

With over 2 years of experience building end-to-end Data Analytics and Machine Learning and Deep Learning pipelines, I have worked on data gathering, analysis, preprocessing and modelling. Skilled in analysing requirements and reporting, demonstrated by multiple projects delivered in the field. Having worked for high-profile clients, I also have exposure to scalable systems, building and testing predictive analytics models utilizing cloud services.

Persevering, thorough and persistent, I love taking up new challenges. With a keen eye for detail, quality and maintainability, a love for open source technologies and a familiarity with academic writing, I love experimenting with new trends in the field and pushing the boundaries of science and technology.
