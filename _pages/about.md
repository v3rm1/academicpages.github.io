I am a focused individual with experience in research, teaching and training as well as consulting.

I easily adapt to the needs of the teaching environment and appreciate the dynamics of interacting with students and peers. With strong fundamentals in the design and implementation of intelligent agents and multi-agent systems, both in theory and in practice, I am passionate about research in the areas of Reinforcement Learning and continuous control systems, and interpretable decision making using multi-agent systems, automaton theory and neural networks.

With over 2 years of experience building end-to-end Data Analytics and Machine Learning and Deep Learning pipelines, I have worked on data gathering, analysis, preprocessing and modelling. Skilled in analysing requirements and reporting, demonstrated by multiple projects delivered in the field. Having worked for high-profile clients, I also have exposure to scalable systems, building and testing predictive analytics models utilizing cloud services.
